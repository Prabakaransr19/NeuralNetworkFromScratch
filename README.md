# ðŸ§  Neural Network From Scratch

A basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built **entirely from scratch** using **NumPy** and **Pandas**, without any machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

This network is trained to classify **handwritten digits** (MNIST dataset) and reaches an accuracy of **~84%**.  
Inspired by the amazing tutorial by [@sentdex (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/w8yWXqWQYmU?si=9glc6zH7wzzrjIS5).
